    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll practice doing a power-analysis during experimental design. As you've seen, power analysis allows you to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows you to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under-sample size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following four factors have an intimate relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any three of these, we can easily determine the fourth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the concept of “Power” in relation to p-value and effect size for hypothesis testing\n",
    "* Understand and critically evaluate the factors influencing the power of an experiment\n",
    "* Perform Power calculation using SciPy and Python\n",
    "* Demonstrate the impact of sample size on statistical power using simulations\n",
    "* Demonstrate the combined effect of sample size and effect size on statistical power using simulations  \n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher wants to study how daily protein supplementation in the elderly population will affect baseline liver fat. The study budget will allow enrollment of 24 patients. Half will be randomized to a placebo group and half to the protein supplement treatment group and the trial will be carried out over one month. It is desired to see whether the mean change in percentage of liver fat from baseline to the end of the study differs between the two groups in the study. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, the researcher writes the null hypothesis: \n",
    "\n",
    "    There is no difference between experimental and control means i.e. H0 is equal to H1\n",

    "And the alternative Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is a difference between experimental and control means i.e. H0 is not equal to H1\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher needs to know what power  will be obtained under the sample size restrictions to identify a change in mean percent liver fat of 0.17. Based on past results, a common standard deviation of 0.21 will be used for each treatment group in the power analysis. \n",

You ran a simulation to determine the sample size that would provide a given value of power (for a given alpha and effect size). Running simulations like this, as well as further investigations regarding required sample sizes for higher power thresholds or smaller effect sizes, is critical in designing meaningful experiments where one can be confident in the subsequent conclusions drawn."
